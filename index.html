  <h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>
    This site was created to allow BYU CS students to gather and disseminate information for other students. It was pointed out that unless resources were available on the official <a href="http://cs.byu.edu">BYU CS</a> website, students were left to find questions to answers on the <a href="https://theboard.byu.edu">100 Hour Board</a>, ask other students via social media, or searching the Internet. A <a href="{{ site.slack.url }}">Slack team</a> was recently started, but for static content, a website seemed appropriate.
  </p>
  <h1>How you can help</h1>
  <p>
    Any one can fork <a href="{{ site.repo.url }}">this website</a>, modify it, and submit <a href="{{ site.repo.url }}/pulls">pull requests</a> to share information. At the moment, we've started with listing course descriptions that give a better idea of what technologies a course uses, what the projects are like, etc. If you have an idea of something that should be easy to find or that BYU CS students should know, pass it along and help the future generations of the program.
  </p>
  <h1>Wiki</h1>
  <p>
    For now, we've decided to use the the <a href="{{ site.wiki.url }}">byu-cs wiki</a> to share information because it's easier to edit markup than HTML.  Feel free to contribute what you know.  Your insights can help many future generations of nerds and hackers...
